# EQUALIZER
### AN OPEN DATA PROJECT FOCUSED ON GENDER INEQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE IN TURKEY
Both media and academic sources frequently highlight a significant disparity in wages and employment between men and women. With this research, we aimed to investigate whether this gap has widened over the past eight years.

We also know that in order to be employed, women need to prove themselves more than men with their education. Are women employed more compared to men when they have a higher education?

EQUALIZER is more than just a data project; it is a comprehensive investigation into the persistent and complex issue of gender inequality in Turkey's labor market. Through meticulous analysis and a focus on both employment and education, supported by robust data from TURKSTAT and EUROSTAT, we hope to contribute valuable insights that can inform future efforts to achieve true gender equality in the workplace.
